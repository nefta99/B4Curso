# How to contribute to LivePage

Thank you for your interest in helping me with LivePage! I really appreciate it!

## Found a bug?

Lets get it fixed! Please try and include as much information to replicate it as you can, ideally if you can provide the URL where LivePage is breaking, it will help me track down what is going wrong.

## Want a new feature?

I want to keep LivePage as simple as I can, though I'm always open hearing new ideas. Open an issue with your idea and I'll gladly consider it.

## Getting a Pull Request merged

I love seeing people contributing, I'll try and review all pull requests as fast as I can! 
However please be aware LivePage is my side project, if I'm taking a while to respond it's because I'm limited for time.
